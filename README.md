## Project Name & Pitch

AniDiscuss.net (CODEPATH WEB102 Final Project Spring 2024)

An application that simulates an online forum for users to discuss anime. Users can post, upvote, and delete posts. Additional features include a search bar, filtering my genre, and sort by created time/number of upvotes. Built with React, Vite, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Project Status

Although this project completes all the required features of the project's instructions, I'd like to implement/fix the following features somewhere in the future to improve AniDiscuss' experience.:
- [ ] Adding an API that contains a list of animes to make the website more dynamic(Might use MyAnimeList API)
- [ ] Fixing the "edit" button so that users can actually edit their posts.
- [ ] Implementing React Router for navigation (pages).
- [ ] Improving the look of the website. It is a bit plain at the moment.
  - [ ] Adding logo
  - [ ] Revising colors, buttons, texts, etc

## Reflection

  - What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
  - What did you set out to build?
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
  - What were some unexpected obstacles?
